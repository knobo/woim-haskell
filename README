UPDATE: 2010-09-28
New version written with parsec. Parses the original woim format better,
and is much easier to extend, in order to parse the whole format. Still
parts are missing.

This is a project I'm doing to learn Haskell. I made a rough draft in
Lisp before I started with Haskell. Lisp version is available here:
http://github.com/knobo/woim-lisp


Changes in the format:
For now I have made one change in the format. Instead of inerpreting *
as an indicator of multiline items, I assumes that it is a multiline
item if the next line is indentet with two spaces more.
NOTE: This is only true for the non-parsec version. The parsec version
can parse everything the right way.

TODO: 

* Make new WoimItemTypes and parse every woim line in to correct type.

* Produce some "useful" output, like json, dot, or xml.

Thanks to |Jedai| on irc.freenode.org for helping me with the old
buildTree function, in the first version. Which was the most difficult 
function as I had to introduce my own state variable to use in the 
recursion.

Again thanks to #haskell, for beeing there while I learned parsec
