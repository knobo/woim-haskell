This is a project I'm doing to learn Haskell. I made a rough draft in
Lisp before I started with Haskell. Lisp version is available here:
http://github.com/knobo/woim-lisp

Changes in the format:
For now I have made one change in the format. Instead of inerpreting *
as an indicator of multiline items, I assumes that it is a multiline
item if the next line is indentet with two spaces more.

TODO: 

* See if I can simplify buildTree with a (the) state monad I read
  about in "Yet Another Haskell Introduction"

* Make new WoimItemTypes and parse every woim line in to correct type.

* Produce some "useful" output, like json, dot, or xml.

Credits:

Thanks to |Jedai| on irc.freenode.org for helping me with the
buildTree function. Which was the most difficult function as I had to
introduce my own state variable to use in the recursion.
